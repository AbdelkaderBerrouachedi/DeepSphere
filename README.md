# Spherical convolutional neural network

The code in this repository implements an efficient generalization of the
popular Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to a sphere.

The implementation is based on [convolutional neural networks on
graphs][gcnn_paper], as implemented [here][gcnn_code].

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SwissDataScienceCenter/scnn.git
   cd scnn
   ```

2. Install the dependencies.
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   **Note**: if you won't be working with a GPU, comment the
   `tensorflow-gpu==1.6.0` line in `requirements.txt` and uncomment the
   `tensorflow==1.6.0` line.

   **Note**: The code has been developed and tested with Python 3.5 and 3.6. It
   should work on Python 2.7 with `requirements_py27.txt`. Please send a PR if
   you encounter an issue.

3. Play with the Jupyter notebooks.
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Using the model

To use our spherical ConvNet on your data, you need:

1. a data matrix where each row is a sample and each column is a feature,
2. a target vector,

See the [usage notebook][usage] for a simple example with fabricated data.
Please get in touch if you are unsure about applying the model to a different
setting.

Below are some notebooks which contain various experiments:
1. Classification of data on the whole sphere
1. Classification of data from part of the sphere
1. Robustness to noise
